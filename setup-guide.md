# üìã Detailed Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up your South Korea AR Map experience step by step.

## üéØ Prerequisites

- A printed map of South Korea (the one you showed me)
- A smartphone with a modern browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- Basic understanding of file management
- GitHub account (for free hosting)

## üì∏ Step 1: Prepare Your Map Image

### Taking the Perfect Reference Photo

1. **Lighting**: Use bright, even lighting (avoid harsh shadows)
2. **Angle**: Take photo straight-on (not at an angle)
3. **Distance**: Fill most of the frame with your map
4. **Focus**: Ensure the image is sharp and clear
5. **Format**: Save as JPG with high quality

### Image Requirements
- **Resolution**: At least 1024x1024 pixels
- **Contrast**: High contrast works best for tracking
- **Details**: Text and borders should be clearly visible
- **File Size**: Under 5MB for web performance

### Save Your Image
- Name it `map-reference.jpg`
- Place it in `assets/images/map-reference.jpg`

## üéØ Step 2: Generate MindAR Image Target

This is the most important step - creating the `.mind` file that MindAR uses to track your map.

### Using the Online Compiler

1. **Go to**: [https://hiukim.github.io/mind-ar-js-doc/tools/compile](https://hiukim.github.io/mind-ar-js-doc/tools/compile)

2. **Upload your image**:
   - Click "Choose File"
   - Select your `map-reference.jpg`
   - Wait for upload to complete

3. **Check the preview**:
   - You should see feature points detected on your map
   - More feature points = better tracking
   - If you see very few points, try a different image with more contrast

4. **Download the target**:
   - Click "Compile" 
   - Download the generated `targets.mind` file
   - Place it in your `assets/` folder (not in a subfolder!)

### Troubleshooting Image Target Generation

**If you get "Not enough feature points":**
- Increase contrast in photo editing software
- Ensure map has detailed text and borders
- Try different lighting when taking the photo
- Avoid blurry or low-resolution images

**If tracking is poor:**
- The printed map must match the reference image exactly
- Same size, same orientation
- No additional elements on the printed version

## üé¨ Step 3: Add Your Videos

### Video Specifications
- **Format**: MP4 (H.264 codec recommended)
- **Size**: Maximum 50MB per video for web performance
- **Duration**: 30-60 seconds works best for mobile
- **Orientation**: Landscape preferred
- **Quality**: 720p is sufficient for mobile viewing

### Required Video Files
Place these in `assets/videos/`:

1. `seoraksan.mp4` - Seoraksan National Park
2. `gangneung.mp4` - Gangneung city and beaches
3. `wolpo.mp4` - Wolpo Beach research facilities
4. `gyeongju.mp4` - Historical Gyeongju sites
5. `busan.mp4` - Busan city highlights

### Video Content Suggestions

**Seoraksan National Park**:
- Autumn foliage footage
- Hiking trails and peaks
- Traditional temples

**Gangneung**:
- Beach scenes
- Coffee culture
- Olympic venues

**Wolpo Beach**:
- Marine research activities
- Laboratory facilities
- Coastal environment

**Gyeongju**:
- UNESCO World Heritage sites
- Ancient tombs and temples
- Historical artifacts

**Busan**:
- Port activities
- City skyline
- Cultural festivals

### Alternative: YouTube Videos
If you don't have local videos, you can use YouTube:

1. Find relevant YouTube videos for each city
2. Get the video ID from the URL (e.g., `dQw4w9WgXcQ` from `https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`)
3. Update the `cityData` object in `index.html`:

```javascript
const cityData = {
    'Busan': {
        description: 'Your description',
        videoUrl: 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/YOUR_VIDEO_ID'
    }
};
```

## üåê Step 4: Deploy to GitHub Pages

### Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in to your account
   - If you don't have an account, click "Sign up" and create one (it's free)

## üì± Step 5: Test Your AR Experience

### Testing Checklist

1. **Open the URL** on your smartphone
2. **Allow camera permissions** when prompted
3. **Point camera at your printed map**
4. **Wait for tracking** (you should see the spinning cylinders)
5. **Tap each city marker** to test interactions
6. **Check video playback** for each location

### Common Issues and Solutions

**"Camera not working"**
- Ensure HTTPS is enabled (GitHub Pages uses HTTPS by default)
- Check browser permissions for camera access
- Try a different browser

**"Map not detected"**
- Ensure printed map matches reference image exactly
- Check lighting conditions
- Hold phone steady at arm's length

**"Markers in wrong positions"**
- The coordinates in the HTML might need adjustment
- Edit the `position` attributes for each city marker

**"Videos not playing"**
- Check file paths are correct
- Ensure videos are in MP4 format
- Try smaller file sizes if loading is slow

## üé® Step 6: Customize Your Experience

### Adjust City Positions

If the markers don't align with cities on your map:

1. **Open `index.html`**
2. **Find the city marker** you want to move
3. **Adjust the `position` attribute**:
   ```html
   <a-cylinder position="x y z" ...>
   ```
   - `x`: Move left (-) or right (+)
   - `y`: Height (keep at 0.1)
   - `z`: Move back (-) or forward (+)

### Change City Colors

Each city marker has a `color` attribute:
```html
<a-cylinder color="#4CAF50" ...>
```

Suggested colors:
- `#4CAF50` - Green
- `#FF5722` - Red-Orange  
- `#2196F3` - Blue
- `#9C27B0` - Purple
- `#FF9800` - Orange

### Modify Descriptions

Update the `cityData` object in the JavaScript section:
```javascript
const cityData = {
    'City Name': {
        description: 'Your custom description here...',
        videoUrl: 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID'
    }
};
```

## üìä Step 7: Share Your Experience

### Create a QR Code
1. Use any QR code generator (qr-code-generator.com)
2. Enter your GitHub Pages URL
3. Download and print the QR code
4. Place it near your map poster

### Usage Instructions for Users
1. **Scan QR code** with phone camera
2. **Allow camera access** when prompted
3. **Point camera at map** 
4. **Wait for markers** to appear
5. **Tap markers** to explore!
